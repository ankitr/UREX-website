                    <h3>Testing the two-pathway model for arousal and gaze in autism</h3>
                    <div class="project-description">
                        <p>Whether the atypical emotion processing seen in individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (autism) is in fact a product of co-occurring alexithymia is a topic of current debate. Of interest is the pattern of eye-gaze behavior and autonomic arousal when exploring emotional facial expressions, both key predictors of the ability to recognise those emotional expressions and to respond appropriately. A major limitation in the field has been the absence of a theoretical model and methodological framework to investigate the heterogeneity in emotion processing and its relation to alexithymia and autism.</p>
                        <p>This study proposes to test a new model to explain emotion-processing difficulties in autism with respect to behavioral, perceptual, physiological and interoceptive accounts of emotion processing.</p>
                        <p>The study will involve lab-based and online testing of clinical and non-clinical participants on a number of emotion processing tasks with eye-tracking and physiological recordings (GSR, HR). The project will explore the use of new clustering techniques (e.g. k-mean clustering) and multilevel modeling analysis of physiological, behavioral and gaze data.</p>

                    <h3>Beyond fixations: novel metrics for gaze and pupillometry research in autism and emotions</h3>
                    <div class="project-description">
                        <p>Most of the eye-tracking research on visual mechanisms of emotion processing in clinical and non-clinical populations has relied on traditional metrics, such as fixation duration, which do not fully leverage the dynamic and complex nature of gaze data.</p>
                        <p>Recent applications of entropy (Shannon & Weaver, 1998) to quantify the spatio-temporal complexity of gaze behavior proved promising in capturing both top down modulation of predictions (in the Bayesian framework) and low level properties that drive social attention (Shiferaw, Downey, & Crewther, 2019). </p>
                        <p>This project aims to systematically evaluate the usefulness of entropy-based models to quantify aspects of gaze behavior to basic and complex social scenes. This study will also assess how entropy based metrics fare when compared to standard eye-tracking measures in capturing experimental manipulations and group differences in autistic and control samples.</p>
                        <p>Pupillometry is also a promising tool to elucidate online aspects of cognitive and emotional functioning (Mathot, 2018). However, pupil data from typical eye-tracking experiments is inherently noisy. This project will explore the applications of Fourier Transforms to decompose pupil signals in tasks of emotional and social scene processing. This project is suitable for students interested in eye-tracking applications to clinical social neuroscience problems such as emotional and social processing in clinical populations.</p>
